# Overview

This is my first complete Unity project that includes sprites, scripts, animations, and audio.

In the game you are a small potato (for now) that is hunted by demons.You can move around with the `Arrow Keys` or `WASD`. You will see a sword at the beggining that you can pick up with `E` and drop with `Q`. When you grab the sword just attack with `LMB`.

I wanted to explore a game framework and stat creating my own ideas as games, this is the purpose of all this labor.
